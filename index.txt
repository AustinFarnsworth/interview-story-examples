I was building a gift exchange generator where you type in names and add them to a list 
for the gift exchange. Then you click random to randomly get paired with someone in from 
that list. It was kinda challenging logic for me being new to javascript. What i ended 
up doing was saving all the names typed in the input into an array. Then using a shuffling
algothrim that basically looped through the array backwards and pulled out a random element
from the array, saving it to a new array. And then looping through the array again but
exluding that element it just pulled out untill it pulls out all the elements in a random 
order. At that point i was able to take that new array and display it in HTML to compare 
with the original list. 

One of my very first projects was making a tic tac toe board. I had no clue what the DOM
was when i was trying to build that. All i knew is that you had to grab elements from the 
HTML page and do something with it. This project took me a lot longer than i should have 
but now i feel more confident in being able to grab a certain element by id, class, or query
and manipulate them using functions. It was fun to learn how to add and delete elements 
with the DOM.
